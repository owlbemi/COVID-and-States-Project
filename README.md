## Dataset Information
**Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Coronavirus Research Centre**

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govex/COVID-19/master/data_tables/demographic_data/demographics_by_state_raw.csv

- Demographics Data (By state in the United States of America)
- Total daily cases, deaths, and vaccines (JHU Centre for Systems Science and Engineering)

## Questions & Findings
- How has COVID-19 affected (confirmed vs deaths) children (infants vs children) across states in the US?
- Has mortality rate by age group influenced vaccination rate by age group?
- Does mortality rate correlate to region?
- How does statesâ€™ party affiliation correlate to an increase / decrease in mortality rates?

## Analysis
For the analysis the followings were used:

- Simple linear regression
- Scatter Plots
- Regional Analysis

## Findings
### Infants vs Non-Infants
Non-infants had a higher number of COVID-19 cases, likely due to factors like school reopening. However, infants had a higher mortality rate, possibly due to a less developed immune system.

### Mortality rate and Vaccination
Older age groups with higher mortality rates also had a significantly higher vaccination rate by the end of 2021, suggesting people were more likely to get vaccinated based on risk.

### Mortality rate and Region
States in the Bible Belt and Midwest had higher mortality rates, potentially due to relaxed COVID-19 policies like mask mandates. Urban population density didn't directly correlate with higher mortality.

### Mortality rate and State Party Affiliation
States that voted Republican in the 2020 election generally had higher mortality rates, possibly linked to less strict social distancing measures. However, population density in the South may also be a contributing factor.
